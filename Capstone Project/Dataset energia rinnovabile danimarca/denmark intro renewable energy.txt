Denmark’s net-zero commitments and advancements with renewables make it a leader in energy transition. The country aims to cut GHG emissions by 70% from 1990 levels by 2030 and for renewables to cover at least half of the country’s total energy consumption by 2030.

Denmark has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, in line with the Paris Agreement. Moreover, the government has agreed to phase-out all coal-fired power by 2030.

The country also has a political agreement in place that targets for renewable energy to cover 100% of electricity and 55% of overall consumption by 2030. In addition, 90% of district heating is to come from non-fossil sources by 2030. The government also aims to end the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2030.

Already, Denmark is a world leader on wind energy. It has the highest share of wind in both total primary energy consumption and electricity of any IEA country. Supported by a flexible domestic power system and a high level of interconnection, Denmark is now widely recognised as a global leader in integrating variable renewable energy while at the same time maintaining a highly reliable and secure electrical-power grid.

Denmark’s large-scale use of combined heat and power plants with heat storage capacity, and the increasing deployment of wind power, offer great potential for efficient integration of heat and electricity systems.
